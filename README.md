# Lake Mendota Ice covered days Prediction


## Summary
- The objective of this project is to predict the number of days Lake Mendota is covered by ice and eventually predict the specific year when the Lake Mendota would be no longer covered by ice
- 
## Motivation

## Dataset

- The dataset (Lake_Mendota.csv) for this program is manually created by myself. I retrieve years and the number of ice covered days of Lake Mendota in Wisconsin Madison from [Wisconsin State Climatology Office](https://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/lakes/Mendota-ice.html). Linear Regression is implemented on this data to calculate and predict the number of ice covered days of Lake Mendota at specific years.
